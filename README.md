# Tiny Transformer: Implementation, Ablations & Attention Modulation

A lightweight Transformer built from scratch, with experiments on how its architecture and attention mechanisms behave.  
This repo is a playground for learning, visualizing, and tweaking Transformers.

---
## 🚀 What’s Inside
- A **Tiny Transformer** implementation with configurable attention heads
- Training on a small **language translation task**
- **Ablation studies**: testing the role of residuals and feed-forward layers
- An experimental **distance-aware attention bias** that encourages local dependencies
- Visualizations of encoder self-attention, decoder self-attention, and cross-attention

## ⚙️ Setup
You can run everything in **Google Colab** (free GPU is enough), or locally with Python 3.9+.

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tiny-transformer.git
cd tiny-transformer

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually:

```bash
pip install transformers torch matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy bertviz
